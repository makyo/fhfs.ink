The invention of writing postdates, invariably, the invention of storytelling. After all, what purpose is there to writing, until you have something to write down?

Excavate these writings, then. Decipher them carefully. Let them, at last, convince you to forget writing until instead they sit across the fire, speaking to you oral traditions, folktales, and of days long, long past *When the World Was Young.*

We invented writing to preserve our stories and to share them with each other. From the mistiest stretches of history we find scraps and pieces of tales we told each other, forming the myths, legends, and dramas that persist to this day.

Hear us, then. Listen to the stories passed down from the earliest foundations of civilizations, to the creation of nations and empires. Hear the stories of the grandest rulers to the humblest peasants. The world is not so young as it was, but walk with us in these tales of antiquity: *In the Light of the Dawn.*
